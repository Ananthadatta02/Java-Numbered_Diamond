# Java-Numbered_Diamond
This Java program prints a symmetrical number diamond pattern based on user input. It first builds the upper half, increasing numbers to the center and then decreasing symmetrically. The lower half mirrors the upper part. Nested loops manage spaces and numbers efficiently to create the desired pattern.
